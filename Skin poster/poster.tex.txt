\section{Introduction}

\begin{block}{Overview}

    The developed application is a web-based system for skin lesion classification using deep learning techniques. Users can upload images of skin lesions, and the system will classify the lesions into one of seven categories with high accuracy. The application provides a user-friendly interface, making it easy to use even for non-experts, and the system is scalable, capable of processing large amounts of data efficiently.
